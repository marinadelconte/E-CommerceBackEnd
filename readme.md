# E-CommerceBackEnd

## Description

This project uses Sequelize, SQL and insomnia to store the back-end information for an e-commerce site. Using these applications we can view and edit inventory to help manage the back-end information.

## Installation

To use this application, run "npm i" in the terminal to install npm. Next ensure that it is seeded by running "npm run seed". Once it appears that it is listening, you can search for the various endpoints using Insomnia.

## Usage

Below is a video of the application in use:

## Credits

We were provided starter code to begin this project. I also used past class activities and the mini challenge as guides. I worked with my tutor in areas where I was having trouble.
